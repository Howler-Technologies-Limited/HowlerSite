## The Lore
In the Harry Potter universe, Howlers were owl-delivered letters read aloud to recipients in senders' voices. The smarthpone application, HowlerÂ®, builds on this; in-app personal voice messages are quickly converted into podcasts that sound like a synchronous conversation ([listen to exemplar Howlcast](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/howler-beta-test.appspot.com/o/howlcasts%2FPFMmCatcLcPHo1XOvfBIjrXDVqI2%2F6D002CC7-1C74-401A-A3AA-A962020DBA23?alt=media&token=e3d8ad8e-b6a7-40bb-8ed0-fd55d9488259)). Howler's vision is to democratise podcasting while providing non-toxic content.

## How can we deliver on both?
1. **Consensus-based publication model**: Consider current social media; Facebook and Instagram users tag others in posts, typically without consent. Twitter power users publish posts as individuals which are not assessed prior to publication. These examples of non-consensus social media incentivise individual actions, leading to polarising toxic content.
   Contrast these to another socially produced media where multi-author publications are more common than solo ones: academic papers. Consent between authors followed by objective review moderates content pre-publication; civil, non-violent communication is the bedrock for achieving publication. Howler embraces a similar model.
2. **AI-augmented moderation**: Incorporating an AI-layer to evaluate content (after podcasters' moderation) pre-publication would support realising a non-toxic social media. At the scale of a global internet, relying on human moderation alone is unrealistic; humans will, of course, continue to provide feedback. Simultaneously, AI-based mechanisms for verification will need to be developed for fake/spam account detection. We believe rapid progress in AI techniques supporting Natural Language Programming technologies (e.g., sentiment analysis of speech and/or voice-to-text for hate speech detection, [speaker diarization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/diarization.html)) will become indispensable in future social media content moderation. This stack will also benefit our users by: aiding podcasters to auto-generate transcripts with speaker identity; and allowing text-based consumption of content by people with hearing disabilities and in noisy environments.
3. **Publication from inbox**: When one considers the volumes of potential content in inboxes that go unpublished (which could be kernels for proposals, blogs, etc.), such easy publication from one's inbox is another valuable novelty.
4. **Flexible creativity**: The space-time flexibility to hosts and guests with asynchronous podcast creation could allow more thoughtful responses and more atomic podcasts.
