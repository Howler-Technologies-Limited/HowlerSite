## Idea
In the Harry Potter universe, Howlers were owl-delivered letters read aloud to recipients in senders' voices. My eponymous idea, Howler®, builds on this; in-app personal voice messages are quickly converted into podcasts that sound like a synchronous conversation ([listen to exemplar Howlcast](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/howler-beta-test.appspot.com/o/howlcasts%2FPFMmCatcLcPHo1XOvfBIjrXDVqI2%2F6D002CC7-1C74-401A-A3AA-A962020DBA23?alt=media&token=e3d8ad8e-b6a7-40bb-8ed0-fd55d9488259)). Howler's vision is to democratise podcasting while providing non-toxic content. **I am requesting support from Emergent Ventures AI to continue building Howler**.

## Novelty
1. **Consensus-based publication model**: Consider current social media; Facebook and Instagram users tag others in posts, typically without consent. Twitter power users publish posts as individuals which are not assessed prior to publication. These examples of non-consensus social media incentivise individual actions, leading to polarising toxic content.
   Contrast these to another socially produced media where multi-author publications are more common than solo ones: academic papers. Consent between authors followed by objective review moderates content pre-publication; civil, non-violent communication is the bedrock for achieving publication. Howler embraces a similar model.
2. **AI-augmented moderation**: Incorporating an AI-layer to evaluate content (after podcasters' moderation) pre-publication would support realising a non-toxic social media. At the scale of a global internet, relying on human moderation alone is unrealistic; humans will, of course, continue to provide feedback. Simultaneously, AI-based mechanisms for verification will need to be developed for fake/spam account detection. We believe rapid progress in AI techniques supporting Natural Language Programming technologies (e.g., sentiment analysis of speech and/or voice-to-text for hate speech detection, [speaker diarization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/diarization.html)) will become indispensable in future social media content moderation. This stack will also benefit our users by: aiding podcasters to auto-generate transcripts with speaker identity; and allowing text-based consumption of content by people with hearing disabilities and in noisy environments.
3. **Publication from inbox**: When one considers the volumes of potential content in inboxes that go unpublished (which could be kernels for proposals, blogs, etc.), such easy publication from one's inbox is another valuable novelty.
4. **Flexible creativity**: The space-time flexibility to hosts and guests with asynchronous podcast creation could allow more thoughtful responses and more atomic podcasts.

### Progress
My achievements from solely driving Howler over ~14 months:
1. __iOS Prototype on App Store__: Single-handedly designed, built, and launched the [iOS prototype](http://apps.apple.com/gb/app/howler/id1591521094) in April 2022 with no prior experience in app development.
2. **Accelerator shortlisting**: Howler is currently shortlisted for [Digital Catapult](https://www.digicatapult.org.uk)'s flagship accelerator program ([Machine Intelligence Garage](https://migarage.digicatapult.org.uk/about-mi-garage/)) to secure $100k of AI cloud computing resources for AI/ML developments. Interview date: 1st July 2022.
3. **Initial User Acquisition**: >70 users recruited (family and friends providing regular feedback to improve the app), some of whom have previously worked in radio and are helping with podcast creation. The next phase will involve acquiring:
	- Comedy podcasters: As a budding standup comic, I have connections to others with popular podcasts; I will approach them to test/create on Howler.
	- Amateur and professional podcasting community: Grow amateur user-base within my university (students, staff, and academics). Request two early Howler users working in radio (a BBC podcaster; and a former KQED employee) to help spread the word in the professional podcasting community.
	- Voice message users: A large community globally and particularly in [developing economies](https://restofworld.org/2021/facebook-didnt-know-why-half-of-messengers-voice-traffic-comes-from-cambodia- heres-why). People with disabilities; e.g. (one current nearly blind user believes Howler is a stronger alternative to WhatsApp-style voice messaging).

### How EV would help
Howler’s main early stage challenge is reaching [”ramen profitability”](http://www.paulgraham.com/ramenprofitable.html) which is why I have tackled by working on it on my own (nearly full-time, alongside my academic post). Emeregent Venures' recognition alongside $250K cash support will help Howler:
1. recruit [Mughees](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mugheesasif) and [John](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnpeterflynn/) to drive Android and AI developments, respectively ($150k shared between three of us);
2. purchase $100k of Google Cloud Platform credits to develop/test AI content moderation;
3. gain visibility, ideally through use in producing Tyler's and Shruti's podcasts.
Howler will hen be in a strong position to pitch investors; and connect to a strong talent pool to scale our team (with Tyler's expertise and network, if possible).
